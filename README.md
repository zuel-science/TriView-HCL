TriView-HCL (Tri-perspective Contrastive Learning for Robust Heterogeneous Graph Representation) is a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs that aims to learn high-quality node representations without relying on labeled data. It introduces three encoders from different perspectives: the target node view, the meta-path view, and the neighbor interaction view. These components work together to comprehensively capture both structural and semantic information. By employing a cross-view contrastive learning strategy, a structure-semantic balanced positive sample selection method, and the Contranorm layer, TriView-HCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and clustering tasks.
